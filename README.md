# Fraud Analytics & Data Science Portfolio  
**By [Renu Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renu-t-prakash/)**  
**Mentored by James Gearheart, VP & Senior Data Scientist (AI/ML), Wells Fargo**

Welcome! This portfolio is a curated collection of hands-on, end-to-end data science and machine learning projects simulating real-world challenges in financial crime detection, risk analytics, and compliance. My work blends AI/ML technical depth, business context, and practical experience to deliver measurable impact across diverse fraud types, modeling challenges, and regulatory domains.

## Why This Portfolio?

Financial fraud is ever-evolving—exploiting identity, behavioral, and system vulnerabilities. Institutions need robust, explainable solutions. Here, I demonstrate how advanced data science and AI can be practically applied to build scalable, risk-aware fraud detection and compliance systems that meet industry and regulatory expectations.

## What Sets Me Apart

- **End-to-End ML Ownership:** Each project covers the full cycle—from data exploration and feature engineering to modeling, evaluation, and interpretability.
- **Business-Aligned Impact:** Solutions are grounded in real business needs, including fraud, risk, and KYC/AML compliance.
- **Breadth & Depth in Data Science:** My portfolio spans classic machine learning, unsupervised anomaly detection, deep learning, clustering, and explainable AI.
- **Outcome Focused:** Projects emphasize measurable results, clear visualizations, and actionable business value.
- **Excellent Communication:** I present findings and methods in a way that’s accessible for both technical and non-technical audiences.

- **Check Kiting Detection using Unsupervised Learning:**  
  Created behavioral features at the customer level and applied Isolation Forest to flag the top 0.5% of high-risk accounts, uncovering patterns consistent with systematic float exploitation in synthetic banking transactions.

- **Synthetic Identity Fraud Detection:**  
  Built advanced classifiers using transactional and identity metadata, ensemble ML, and clustering to detect synthetic and impersonated identities—achieving a 41% increase in fraud recall and surfacing high-risk clusters via account velocity and device fingerprinting.
