# Fraud Analytics with AI/ML Portfolio  
**Curated by [Renu Prakash](https://github.com/RP-333)**  
**Mentored by James Gearheart, VP & Senior Data Scientist (AI/ML), Wells Fargo**

Welcome to my fraud analytics portfolio — a collection of hands-on, end-to-end projects designed to simulate real-world challenges in financial crime detection using AI and machine learning. This repository showcases my practical skillset across a range of fraud types, modeling techniques, and regulatory contexts.

---

## Business Context  
Fraud continues to evolve in complexity, exploiting gaps in identity, transaction behavior, and system vulnerabilities. Financial institutions demand proactive, explainable, and data-driven solutions that adapt in real time.

Through this portfolio, I demonstrate how modern data science — from exploratory analysis to advanced AI — can be used to build scalable, risk-aware fraud detection systems aligned with industry needs.

## Core Competencies

- **AI-Driven Fraud Detection**: Building ML models that identify and prevent high-risk activities
- **Behavioral & Identity Analytics**: Capturing fraud signals from devices, metadata, and human patterns
- **Hands-on Project Execution**: Full-cycle implementation from data ingestion to model validation
- **Compliance-Aware Design**: Bridging technical solutions with KYC/AML regulatory needs

---

## Project Portfolio

### Exploratory Data Analysis – Credit Card Fraud
Performed a comprehensive EDA on credit card transactions to surface trends, outliers, and patterns related to fraud.

- **Techniques**: Summary statistics, correlation heatmaps, KDE plots, time-based binning, outlier detection  
- **Outcome**: Visual and statistical insights foundational to model design, risk scoring, and AML flag design

### Project 1: Transaction Fraud Detection
Developed an AI/ML pipeline to classify fraudulent transactions in imbalanced datasets.

- **Techniques**: Random Forest, SMOTE, PCA, hyperparameter tuning, SHAP-based feature attribution  
- **Outcome**: Fraud recall improved from 6% to 24%; supported sustained performance through model monitoring and threshold optimization

---

### Project 2: Identity Fraud Detection
Trained a fraud classifier using both transactional and identity metadata to catch impersonation and synthetic identity attempts.

- **Techniques**: XGBoost, K-Means clustering, feature engineering from identity and credit metadata  
- **Outcome**: Achieved 41% increase in fraud recall; detected high-risk clusters based on account velocity and device data

---

### Project 3: Account Takeover Fraud Detection
Modeled ATO and check kiting risks using behavior-based features to detect unauthorized session activity and financial manipulation.

- **Techniques**: Time-based features, ensemble models, anomaly detection  
- **Outcome**: Multi-model comparison under class imbalance conditions, including PCA + Random Forest

---

### Project 4: Deepfake Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks
Built advanced ML and deep learning models to detect synthetic identities and manipulated media used in fraudulent verification processes.

- **Techniques**: CNN, TensorFlow, MobileNetV2, hybrid tabular + image models  
- **Outcome**: Achieved 88% accuracy; demonstrated superior performance over metadata-only models

### Project 5: KYC/AML Compliance System
Designed an end-to-end AI-based fraud monitoring system aligned with KYC and AML guidelines.

- **Techniques**: Regulatory feature design, risk scoring, compliance dashboard simulation  
- **Outcome**: Simulated production-ready engine for transaction monitoring and AML compliance
