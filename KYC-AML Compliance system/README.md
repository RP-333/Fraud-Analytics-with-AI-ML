# AI for AML/KYC: Detecting Financial Crime with Machine Learning

**A Portfolio Integrating AI/ML, Domain Expertise, and Real-World Risk Models**

## Why This Matters

As global finance digitizes, fraud risks grow more sophisticated. Criminals now exploit not just regulatory gaps but the delay between rulemaking and technology. From synthetic identities to deepfaked documents and complex money laundering webs—traditional rule-based systems are no longer enough.

This project demonstrates how modern AI and ML techniques can help financial institutions meet their AML/KYC obligations while reducing false positives, improving detection, and supporting compliance teams with explainable tools.

## My Journey: From Core Banking to Applied AI in Financial Crime

At Punjab National Bank—India’s second-largest state-owned bank—I developed a CHAID-based Credit Fault Probability Model aligned with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations. This model:

- Segmented borrowers by repayment risk
- Flagged early signs of credit fraud
- Supported RBI-aligned reporting and alerting systems

This work laid the foundation for my current AI-driven approach to financial crime: combining domain understanding with technical rigor and interpretability.
