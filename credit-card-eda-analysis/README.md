# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Credit Card Transactions

This project performs a deep dive into a credit card transaction dataset, uncovering insights critical to understanding fraud patterns and informing model development.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To conduct foundational EDA to identify:
- Key variables contributing to fraud
- Data imbalance
- Outlier behavior
- Visualization-based insights

---

## 🔍 Techniques Used

- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots
- Class distribution visualization
- Outlier detection (Z-score, IQR)

---

## 📁 Dataset

Public credit card transaction dataset (Kaggle):
- 284,807 transactions
- Highly imbalanced (fraud ≈ 0.17%)

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Jupyter Notebook with clean, annotated visual analysis
- Key takeaways to inform modeling
- Fraud trend identification and feature insights
