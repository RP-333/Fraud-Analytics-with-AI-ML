    "# Proof of Concept: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Check Kiting Fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Check kiting is a fraudulent scheme in which individuals exploit the delay in check clearance—known as \"float\"—to create artificially inflated account balances. This is typically done by writing checks between multiple accounts and rapidly moving funds before the original checks clear. These behaviors are subtle, fast-moving, and difficult to detect using traditional rule-based systems or supervised models, which often rely on labeled fraud data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world banking environments, labeled fraud data may be sparse or delayed. Unsupervised anomaly detection allows institutions to identify suspicious behavioral patterns based on deviations from expected norms—making it a valuable tool in early-stage fraud detection and financial crime prevention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to simulate a real-world fraud analytics workflow using unsupervised learning to detect potential check kiting behavior. We apply an Isolation Forest model to flag anomalous transactions or accounts based on patterns such as transaction velocity, transfer frequency, and irregular timing—without using any fraud labels during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to prioritize cases for investigation and enhance early fraud detection in environments where labeled fraud examples are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the **BankSim Synthetic Dataset**, which simulates real-world banking transactions and includes features such as customer IDs, transaction time steps, amounts, and merchant categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature        | Description                                                 |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `step`         | Time of transaction (in hours since start of simulation)    |\n",
    "| `customer`     | Unique anonymized customer ID                               |\n",
    "| `age`, `gender`| Customer demographic features                               |\n",
    "| `merchant`     | Receiving merchant                                           |\n",
    "| `category`     | Transaction category (e.g., bills, travel, transfer)        |\n",
    "| `amount`       | Transaction amount                                           |\n",
    "| `fraud`        | Binary label: 0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud (used for evaluation only) |\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: While the dataset includes a `fraud` column, it is **not used during model training**. It is only used for post-model evaluation to benchmark anomaly detection performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This dataset is sourced from a public Kaggle repository and is fully synthetic — no real customer data is used.\n",

    "- **Dropped Columns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `customer`, `merchant`, `zipcodeOri`, and `zipMerchant` are dropped because they serve as unique or semi-unique IDs.\n",

    "    - These features don't generalize across accounts and might bias the model toward memorizing patterns instead of detecting behavioral anomalies.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - `category`, `gender`, and `age` are originally string/object types.\n",

    "    - These are converted into numerical codes using `.astype('category').cat.codes` so they can be used by the machine learning model.\n",

    "The `df_cleaned.head()` output shows that all variables are now numeric. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'F'` and `'M'` in gender have become values like 0 and 1.\n",

    "We want to **interpret the model's decision-making** by comparing flagged accounts to typical behavior. Specifically, we're asking:\n",

    "- Do flagged accounts have **significantly higher or lower transaction averages**?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are they outliers in how they move money?\n",

    "- Accounts flagged as **anomalies** (`-1`) tend to have **much higher average transaction values** compared to the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is consistent with **check kiting behavior**, where <u>large transactions are cycled to create the illusion of available funds.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **normal accounts** (`1`) cluster around much smaller average values, with many tightly packed low-amount users.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us confidence that the model is identifying **high-value behavioral outliers**, which are good candidates for further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, we’ll explore other features like `tx_step_std` and `tx_amt_std` to further analyze what sets these accounts apart."

    "## 📊 Comparing Transaction Timing Variability (`tx_step_std`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve seen average transaction amounts differ significantly between flagged and normal accounts, let’s examine another behavioral dimension: **transaction timing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we’re looking at `tx_step_std` — the **standard deviation of the transaction step values** (i.e., how regularly the account transacts over time).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In check kiting schemes, fraudsters often **repeat transactions in a predictable and mechanical pattern**. This reduces the standard deviation of the transaction steps — in other words, they make **transactions at regular intervals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we observe **lower `tx_step_std` values** in flagged accounts, it could mean:\n",
    "- The account is operating on a rigid schedule\n",
    "- There may be **automated or scripted** behavior\n",
    "- It’s a potential signal of **float exploitation** typical in check kiting\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 What to Look For\n",
    "Are `-1` (flagged) accounts less variable in their timing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a **visible separation** between the flagged and normal account distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do flagged accounts look like **behavioral outliers**, not just numerical anomalies?\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we’ll compare `tx_amt_std` (amount variability) to see whether flagged accounts are also repeating the **same amounts** — another classic sign of scripting and float manipulation.\n"

    "### 📌 What the Output Tells Us\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flagged accounts (`-1`) show a **lower median `tx_step_std`** than normal accounts.\n",
    "- This indicates that flagged accounts **transact more consistently** — with **less variation in timing**.\n",
    "- Normal accounts (`1`) exhibit a **wider spread** and **more variability** in their transaction timing.\n",
    "- This supports the hypothesis that **check kiting behavior is more structured**, with transactions happening on a **repeatable, possibly automated schedule** — consistent with efforts to **exploit float windows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why This Is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower timing variability is a red flag for **synthetic behavior**.\n",
    "- Consistent, clockwork-like activity often suggests a **non-human or fraud-driven intent**.\n",
    "- This aligns well with what we expect from **float exploitation schemes**, where **precise timing is critical** to success.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We’ve now seen how flagged accounts differ in both **average transaction size** and **transaction timing**.  \n",
    "> In the next step, we’ll analyze **transaction amount variability** to complete the behavioral profile.\n"

    "### 📌 What the Output Tells Us\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flagged accounts (`-1`) have **significantly higher variability** in transaction amounts.\n",
    "- Normal accounts (`1`) cluster around **very low standard deviations**, with many accounts making transactions of roughly the same value.\n",
    "- This suggests that flagged accounts exhibit a **much broader range of transaction amounts** — possibly alternating between **large deposits and small withdrawals**, or vice versa.\n",
    "- It may also indicate **staggered float manipulation**, where varying amounts are used to **mask systematic cycling behavior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why This Is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "- While **low variability (`tx_amt_std`)** can suggest scripting, **high variability** in this dataset seems to **distinguish the most suspicious accounts**.\n",
    "- This aligns with one form of **check kiting**, where the fraudster **tests float limits** by alternating values across cycles.\n",
    "- Combined with the previously observed behaviors —  \n",
    "  ✅ **High average amounts**  \n",
    "  ✅ **Lower timing variability**  \n",
    "  ✅ **Extreme amount variability**  \n",
    "\n",
    "— this adds weight to the model’s decision and provides a **3-dimensional behavioral profile**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Together, these characteristics define the **behavioral fingerprint of likely check kiters** in this dataset.\n"

    "## ✅ Final Summary and Wrap-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explored how **unsupervised machine learning** techniques can be used to detect **check kiting fraud**, a behavioral pattern that often goes unnoticed in transactional monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the `BankSim` dataset to simulate how real-world financial institutions might approach this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What We Did\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loaded and explored real-world financial data**\n",
    "   - Identified extreme class imbalance (fraud rate ~1.2%)\n",
    "   - Cleaned and encoded categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Engineered customer-level behavioral features**\n",
    "   - Total transaction count\n",
    "   - Timing variability (`tx_step_std`)\n",
    "   - Average and total amount\n",
    "   - Amount variability (`tx_amt_std`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trained an Isolation Forest model**\n",
    "   - No labels were used for training (unsupervised)\n",
    "   - Flagged 21 accounts as anomalies based on behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualized and interpreted flagged accounts**\n",
    "   - Flagged accounts showed:\n",
    "     - **Higher average transaction amounts**\n",
    "     - **Lower variability in transaction timing**\n",
    "     - **Higher variability in transaction amounts**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check kiting is a behavioral fraud**, often missed by rule-based or supervised systems.\n",
    "- **Isolation Forest** is a fast and scalable unsupervised method ideal for this type of detection.\n",
    "- **Behavioral feature engineering is critical** — the model can only detect what you define and feed it.\n",
    "- **Interpretability matters**: Through visualizations, we were able to understand and validate model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 What Comes Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human review** of flagged accounts for confirmation and investigation.\n",
    "- Use this process to inform **risk scoring models** or **real-time alerting systems**.\n",
    "- Extend this analysis by:\n",
    "  - Adding time-series sequence models (e.g., LSTMs)\n",
    "  - Integrating external data (e.g., device, location, login patterns)\n",
    "  - Combining supervised and unsupervised approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> This demo showcased how data science can uncover hidden patterns in transactional data — giving fraud analysts a powerful head start against behavioral threats like check kiting.\n"
