# Detecting Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud Using AI/ML

**Author:** Renu Prakash

---

## Business Objective

Account Takeover (ATO) is a major threat in digital banking. This project delivers a machine learning solution that detects ATO fraud using behavioral signals in transaction data, helping financial institutions protect customer assets and trust.

---

## Project Highlights

- End-to-end pipeline: data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation using synthetic online banking data.
- Focused on severe class imbalanceâ€”leveraging SMOTE and tree-based models for robust fraud detection.
- Built advanced behavioral features from event sequences, device/location changes, and abnormal activity times.
- Achieved high recall and operational explainability to meet fintech and banking risk management needs.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Data Science:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Random Forest, train/test split, class balancing, evaluation metrics)
- **Feature Engineering:** Behavioral pattern extraction, categorical encoding, event sequence analysis
- **Imbalance Handling:** SMOTE oversampling
- **Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, F1-score, ROC-AUC, precision/recall
